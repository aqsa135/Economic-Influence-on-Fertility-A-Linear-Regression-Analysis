# Economic Influence on Fertility: A Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between Fertility rates and Gross National Product per capita (PPgdp) using linear regression techniques. The data is sourced from the United Nations and includes various countries' fertility rates and PPgdp values.

## Objective
To explore and model the relationship between a nation's fertility rate and its per capita GNP, using linear regression analysis.

## Data
The dataset contains three columns: Locality, Fertility, and PPgdp. Fertility is the birth rate per 1000 females, and PPgdp is the gross national product per person in US dollars for the year 2001.

## Methodology
The project includes several key steps:

1. Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial scatter plot of Fertility vs. PPgdp and analysis of data distribution.
2. Data Transformation: Logarithmic transformation of both Fertility and PPgdp to linearize their relationship.
3. Model Fitting: Application of linear regression models to the transformed data, using both formula-based and matrix manipulation methods.
4. Model Diagnostics: Analysis of residual plots and other diagnostic tools to validate the model.
5. Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating the statistical significance of the model's coefficients.
6. Confidence Interval Estimation: Calculating confidence intervals for expected fertility rates in regions with specific PPgdp values.
7. Additional Analysis: Providing confidence bands for the regression model and exploring prediction intervals.

## Results
The analysis revealed a statistically significant negative linear relationship between log-transformed PPgdp and log-transformed Fertility. The model's diagnostics indicated a good fit with minor concerns about normality in the tails of the distribution.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of linear regression techniques in understanding the relationship between a nation's economic status and its fertility rate, emphasizing the importance of data transformation in revealing underlying patterns.
